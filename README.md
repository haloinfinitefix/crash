If you have had experience of a halo infinite DirectX Error, then EA recommend that you start by updating or reinstalling your video drivers. We’d recommend making sure that all your software is fully updated. In many cases, this will resolve the issue. But just in case this doesn’t work, there are some further steps you can try:

Disable any third-party software you may have running alongside the game. Programs like Discord, RGB, or MSI Afterburner, or even overlays like GeForce Experience, Steam, or Origins.
